# Metastable-dynamics

## What is it?

This is the Mathematica code to trace the evolution of metastable species -- pions, muons, and kaons -- injected by decays of hypothetical Long-Lived Particles (LLPs) in the MeV primordial plasma of the Early Universe. The code incorporates various processes with metastable particles: decays, annihilations, and interactions with nucleons, and solves the system of integrated Boltzmann equations on their number densities. The output may be used for various solvers of neutrino Boltzmann equations. 


## How to launch

Just launch the initialization cells in the main notebook <dt><code>main.nb</code></dt> and follow the Appendix of .

## Requirements

The code requires [FeynCalc](https://feyncalc.github.io/) package that may be easily installed inside Mathematica.
